abstract = {This article provides a general overview of the field now known as evolution- ary multi-objective optimization, which refers to the use of evolutionary algo- rithms to solve problems with two or more (often conflicting) objective functions. Using as a framework the history of this discipline, we discuss some of the most representative algorithms that have been developed so far, as well as some of their applications. Also, we discuss some of the methodological issues related to the use of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, as well as some of the current and future research trends in the area.},

abstract = {Walking behavior is modulated by controlling joint torques in most existing passivity-based bipeds. Controlled Passive Walking with adaptable stiffness exhibits controllable natural motions and energy efficient gaits. In this paper, we propose torque-stiffness-controlled dynamic bipedal walking, which extends the concept of Controlled Passive Walking by introducing structured control parameters and a bio-inspired control method with central pattern generators. The proposed walking paradigm is beneficial in clarifying the respective effects of the external actuation and the internal natural dynamics. We present a seven-link biped model to validate the presented walking. Effects of joint torque and joint stiffness on gait selection, walking performance and walking pattern transitions are studied in simulations. The work in this paper develops a new solution of motion control of bipedal robots with adaptable stiffness and provides insights of efficient and sophisticated walking gaits of humans.},

NSPSO extends the basic form of PSO by making a better use of particles’ personal bests and offspring for more effective nondomination comparisons. Instead of a single comparison between a particle’s personal best and its offspring, NSPSO compares all particles’ personal bests and their offspring in the entire population. This proves to be effective in providing an appropriate selection pressure to propel the swarm population towards the Pareto-optimal front. By using the non-dominated sorting concept and two parameter-free niching methods, NSPSO and its variants have shown remarkable performance against a set of well-known difficult test functions (ZDT series). Our results and comparison with NSGA II show that NSPSO is highly competitive with existing evolutionary and PSO multiobjective algorithms.},

@article{Matsuoka1985,
abstract = {Autonomic oscillatory activities exist in almost every living thing and most of them are produced by rhythmic activities of the corresponding neural systems (locomotion, respiration, heart beat, etc.). This paper mathematically discusses sustained oscillations generated by mutual inhibition of the neurons which are represented by a continuous-variable model with a kind of fatigue or adaptation effect. If the neural network has no stable stationary state for constant input stimuli, it will generate and sustain some oscillation for any initial state and for any disturbance. Some sufficient conditions for that are given to three types of neural networks: lateral inhibition networks of linearly arrayed neurons, symmetric inhibition networks and cyclic inhibition networks. The result suggests that the adaptation of the neurons plays a very important role for the appearance of the oscillations. Some computer simulations of rhythmic activities are also presented for cyclic inhibition networks consisting of a few neurons.},

abstract = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use non-dominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1) their O(MN<sup>3</sup>) computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism approach; and (3) the need to specify a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN<sup>2</sup>) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed},

abstract = {Compared with wheeled mobile robots, legged robots can easily step over obstacles and walk through rugged ground. They have more flexible bodies and therefore, can deal with complex environment. Nev- ertheless, some other issues make the locomotion control of legged robots a much complicated task, such as the redundant degree of freedoms and balance keeping. From literatures, locomotion control has been solved mainly based on programming mechanism. To use this method, walking trajectories for each leg and the gaits have to be designed, and the adaptability to an unknown environment cannot be guaranteed. From another aspect, studying and simulating animals’ walking mechanism for engi- neering application is an efficient way to break the bottleneck of locomotion control for legged robots. This has attracted more and more attentions. Inspired by central pattern generator (CPG), a control method has been proved to be a successful attempt within this scope. In this paper, we will review the biological mechanism, the existence evidences, and the network properties of CPG. From the en- gineering perspective, we will introduce the engineering simulation of CPG, the property analysis, and the research progress of CPG inspired control method in locomotion control of legged robots. Then, in our research, we will further discuss on existing problems, hot issues, and future research directions in this field},

abstract = {Compliant elements in the leg musculoskeletal system appear to be important not only for running but also for walking in human locomotion as shown in the energetics and kinematics studies of spring-mass model. While the spring-mass model assumes a whole leg as a linear spring, it is still not clear how the compliant elements of muscle-tendon systems behave in a human-like segmented leg structure. This study presents a minimalistic model of compliant leg structure that exploits dynamics of biarticular tension springs. In the proposed bipedal model, each leg consists of three leg segments with passive knee and ankle joints that are constrained by four linear tension springs. We found that biarticular arrangements of the springs that correspond to rectus femoris, biceps femoris and gastrocnemius in human legs provide self-stabilizing characteristics for both walking and running gaits. Through the experiments in simulation and a real-world robotic platform, we show how behavioral characteristics of the proposed model agree with basic patterns of human locomotion including joint kinematics and ground reaction force, which could not be explained in the previous models. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A healthy gait pattern depends on an array of biomechanical features, orchestrated by the central nervous system for economy and stability. Injuries and other pathologies can alter these features and result in substantial gait deficits, often with detrimental consequences for energy expenditure and balance. An understanding of the role of biomechanics in the generation of healthy gait, therefore, can provide insight into these deficits. This article examines the basic principles of gait from the standpoint of dynamic walking, an approach that combines an inverted pendulum model of the stance leg with a pendulum model of the swing leg and its impact with the ground. The heel-strike at the end of each step has dynamic effects that can contribute to a periodic gait and its passive stability. Biomechanics, therefore, can account for much of the gait pattern, with additional motor inputs that are important for improving economy and stability. The dynamic walking approach can predict the consequences of disruptions to normal biomechanics, and the associated observations can help explain some aspects of impaired gait. This article reviews the basic principles of dynamic walking and the associated experimental evidence for healthy gait and then considers how the principles may be applied to clinical gait pathologies.},

abstract = {It has been shown that sensory morphology and sensory-motor coordination enhance the capabilities of sensing in robotic systems. The tasks of categorization and category learning, for example, can be significantly simplified by exploiting the morphological constraints, sensory-motor couplings and the interaction with the environment. This paper argues that, in the context of sensory-motor control, it is essential to consider body dynamics derived from morphological properties and the interaction with the environment in order to gain additional insight into the underlying mechanisms of sensory-motor coordination, and more generally the nature of perception. A locomotion model of a four-legged robot is used for the case studies in both simulation and real world. The locomotion model demonstrates how attractor states derived from body dynamics influence the sensory information, which can then be used for the recognition of stable behavioral patterns and of physical properties in the environment. A comprehensive analysis of behavior and sensory information leads to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which body dynamics can be exploited for category learning of autonomous robotic systems. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Like human walking, passive dynamic walking-i.e. walking down a slope with no actuation except gravity-is energy efficient by exploiting the natural dynamics. In the animal world, neural oscillators termed central pattern generators (CPGs) provide the basic rhythm for muscular activity in locomotion. We present a CPG model, which automatically tunes into the resonance frequency of the passive dynamics of a bipedal walker, i.e. the CPG model exhibits resonance tuning behavior. Each leg is coupled to its own CPG, controlling the hip moment of force. Resonance tuning above the endogenous frequency of the CPG-i.e. the CPG's eigenfrequency-is achieved by feedback of both limb angles to their corresponding CPG, while integration of the limb angles provides resonance tuning at and below the endogenous frequency of the CPG. Feedback of the angular velocity of both limbs to their corresponding CPG compensates for the time delay in the loop coupling each limb to its CPG. The resonance tuning behavior of the CPG model allows the gait velocity to be controlled by a single parameter, while retaining the energy efficiency of passive dynamic walking.},

abstract = {Traditionally, in cognitive science the emphasis is on studying cognition from a computational point of view. Studies in biologically inspired robotics and embodied intelligence, however, provide strong evidence that cognition cannot be analyzed and understood by looking at computational processes alone, but that physical system-environment interaction needs to be taken into account. In this opinion article, we review recent progress in cognitive developmental science and robotics, and expand the notion of embodiment to include soft materials and body morphology in the big picture. We argue that we need to build our understanding of cognition from the bottom up; that is, all the way from how our body is physically constructed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Ether some techniques are in general superior to others, which algorithms are suited to which kind of problem, and what the specific advantages and drawbacks of certain methods are. The subject of this work is the comparison and the improvement of existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and their application to system design problems in computer engineering. In detail, the major contributions are: An experimental methodology to compare multiobjective optimizers is devel- oped. In particular, quantitative measures to assess the quality of trade-off fronts are introduced and a set of general test problems is defined, which are i) easy to formulate, ii) represent essential aspects of real-world problems, and iii) test for different types of problem difficulty. On the basis of this methodology, an extensive comparison of numerous evolu- tionary techniques is performed in which further aspects such as the influence of elitism and the population size are also investigated. A novel approach to multiobjective optimization, the strength Pareto evolution- ary algorithm, is proposed. It combines both established and new techniques in a unique manner. Two complex multicriteria applications are addressed using evolutionary algo- rithms: i) the automatic synthesis of heterogeneous hardware/systems and ii) the multidimensional exploration of software implementations for digital signal processors.},

@article{Marques2014,
abstract = {In mammals, the developmental path that links the primary behaviours observed during foetal stages to the full fledged behaviours observed in adults is still beyond our understanding. Often theories of motor control try to deal with the process of incremental learning in an abstract and modular way without establishing any correspondence with the mammalian developmental stages. In this paper, we propose a computational model that links three distinct behaviours which appear at three different stages of development. In order of appearance, these behaviours are: spontaneous motor activity (SMA), reflexes, and coordinated behaviours, such as locomotion. The goal of our model is to address in silico four hypotheses that are currently hard to verify in vivo: First, the hypothesis that spinal reflex circuits can be self-organized from the sensor and motor activity induced by SMA. Second, the hypothesis that supraspinal systems can modulate reflex circuits to achieve coordinated behaviour. Third, the hypothesis that, since SMA is observed in an organism throughout its entire lifetime, it provides a mechanism suitable to maintain the reflex circuits aligned with the musculoskeletal system, and thus adapt to changes in body morphology. And fourth, the hypothesis that by changing the modulation of the reflex circuits over time, one can switch between different coordinated behaviours. Our model is tested in a simulated musculoskeletal leg actuated by six muscles arranged in a number of different ways. Hopping is used as a case study of coordinated behaviour. Our results show that reflex circuits can be self-organized from SMA, and that, once these circuits are in place, they can be modulated to achieve coordinated behaviour. In addition, our results show that our model can naturally adapt to different morphological changes and perform behavioural transitions.},

Dynamic models for bipeds are hybrid in nature. They contain both continuous and discrete elements, with switching events that are governed by a combination of unilateral constraints and impulse-like forces that occur at foot touchdown. Control laws for these machines must be hybrid as well.

abstract = {The delivery of goods is a crucial operational process, which is at the heart of the supply chain and logistic fields. Numerous companies have known a significant drop of their running costs due to the efficient coping with distribution networks. Therefore, several studies in operational research area are interested in modeling and solving transportation problems, especially vehicle routing problems (VRPs). Due to the NP-Hardness of VRPs, various state-of-the-art metaheuristics were developed to generate near-optimal solutions in a reasonable computational time. Against this background, we study in this paper the capacitated vehicle routing problem with distance constraints (DCVRP) consisting in deriving the most favorable vehicle pathways that minimize the vehicles’ traveled distances subject to system requirements. The set of vehicles, based on a central depot, has a maximum weight capacity and can travel up to an allowed maximum distance. To tackle the DCVRP, we formulate it as an integer-programming problem and propose a hybrid swarm-based metaheuristic, named PSO-VNS, which integrates a variable neighborhood search within the particle swarm optimization. Results conducted on benchmark instances show that the proposed PSO-VNS approach is highly competitive, compared to existing solution approaches, and converges to promising solutions.},

abstract = {The basic mechanics of human locomotion are associated with vaulting over stiff legs in walking and rebounding on compliant legs in running. However, while rebounding legs well explain the stance dynamics of running, stiff legs cannot reproduce that of walking. With a simple bipedal spring-mass model, we show that not stiff but compliant legs are essential to obtain the basic walking mechanics; incorporating the double support as an essential part of the walking motion, the model reproduces the characteristic stance dynamics that result in the observed small vertical oscillation of the body and the observed out-of-phase changes in forward kinetic and gravitational potential energies. Exploring the parameter space of this model, we further show that it not only combines the basic dynamics of walking and running in one mechanical system, but also reveals these gaits to be just two out of the many solutions to legged locomotion offered by compliant leg behaviour and accessed by energy or speed.},
